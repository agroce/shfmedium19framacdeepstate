\subsection{Generation of Timed Automata Model Skeletons}
As noted above, one of our core assumptions is that timed automata can
model the underlying protocols in many embedded systems.  However,
analysis of timed automata models using \uppaal~\cite{uppaal} and
\prism~\cite{KNP2011:CAV} is at present a skill only a small number of
embedded engineers have mastered.  In order to encourage more
engineers to make use of these powerful formalisms, we will also
develop a method to extract timed automata model skeletons for both of these
model checkers from annotated C code.  

\subsection{Case Studies} % for Ecological Monitoring and Control}
\label{sec:case-study}

The above briefly introduces a number of problems that we know in advance must
be dealt with in order to enable a pathway for combining formal,
static, and dynamic analysis.    At heart, however, we aim to allow
\emph{case studies} to prioritize our efforts, and
are certain that other challenges will arise during these efforts.
The studies informing this research is the embedded software of wireless sensor nodes used in the Southwest Experimental Garden Array (SEGA)~\cite{ClaEtAl11,GhoEtAl2014,BelEtAl2015} and of wireless sensor nodes and mobile robots in the Distributed Sensing \& Computing Over Sparse Environments (DISCOVER) Platform.
