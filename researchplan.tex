\subsection{Generation of Timed Automata Model Skeletons}
As noted above, one of our core assumptions is that timed automata can
model the underlying protocols in many embedded systems.  However,
analysis of timed automata models using \uppaal~\cite{uppaal} and
\prism~\cite{KNP2011:CAV} is at present a skill only a small number of
embedded engineers have mastered.  In order to encourage more
engineers to make use of these powerful formalisms, we will also
develop a method to extract time automata models for both of these
model checkers from annotated C code.  By providing some additional
information with the timing constraints that are included for
checking during verification of the implementation, engineers can also
make use of these tools.

\subsection{Case-Study-Driven Problem Determination}

The above briefly introduces a number of problems that we know in advance must
be dealt with in order to enable a pathway for combining formal,
static, and dynamic analysis.    However, we aim to allow the case
studies described below prioritize our work, to a large extent, and
are certain that other challenges will arise from having real
engineers apply our approach to real systems.
