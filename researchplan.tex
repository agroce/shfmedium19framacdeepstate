\subsection{Generation of Timed Automata Model Skeletons}
As noted above, one of our core assumptions is that timed automata can
model the underlying protocols in many embedded systems.  However,
analysis of timed automata models using \uppaal~\cite{uppaal} and
\prism~\cite{KNP2011:CAV} is at present a skill only a small number of
embedded engineers have mastered.  In order to encourage more
engineers to make use of these powerful formalisms, we will also
develop a method to extract timed automata model skeletons for both of these
model checkers from annotated C code.  

\subsection{Case Study: Sensor/Actuator Networks for Ecological Monitoring and Control}
\label{sec:case-study}

The above briefly introduces a number of problems that we know in advance must
be dealt with in order to enable a pathway for combining formal,
static, and dynamic analysis.    At heart, however, we aim to allow
\emph{case studies} to prioritize our efforts, and
are certain that other challenges will arise during these efforts.
