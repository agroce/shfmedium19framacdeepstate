While automated test generation by fuzzing or binary-level symbolic execution can be highly effective as a means for finding bugs in code, other approaches are also needed to handle the kinds of code especially common in embedded contexts.  In particular, embedded software often includes a large number of functions that perform complex low-level bit operations, especially for interacting with hardware and ``parsing'' network packets (from traditional wireless or RF-derived signals) communicating in very low-level protocols.

CBMC, the C Bounded Model Checker~\cite{cbmcp} is a well-known tool that analyzes C programs using a translation to SAT or SMT queries based on a bounded unrolling of loops. CBMC is an actively developed project, and has been used extensively in real-world development for years, including in automotive/embedded code development at Bosch and General Electric~\cite{tiemeyer2019crest}, in analysis of Amazon Web Services infrastructure~\cite{awsmodel}, and in the analysis of flight software systems at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory~\cite{CFV08}.  Using CBMC requires writing custom test harnesses using CBMC's API for expressing nondeterminism, and running the tool with a specified bound on loop executions, in addition to a number of other configuration options, which are often non-obvious (for example, which safety properties of code are checked by default has changed with some releases of the tool, sometimes causing silent failures of ``working'' CBMC harness code).

We propose to allow CBMC to be used as a backend for verification by DeepState, similarly to how DeepState supports symbolic analysis engines such as angr and Manticore.  It is notoriously hard to guess when SAT/SMT based approached to code analysis will work well and when they will fail to scale; using a DeepState harness will allow users to try both CBMC and other test generation approaches without the effort of writing multiple harnesses.
